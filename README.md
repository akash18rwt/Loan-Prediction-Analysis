# Loan-Prediction-Analysis
Predicting whether customer will get a loan or not.

Prediction made using various classification models:
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* KNN Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

Outlier detection and removal helped in removing the skewness of the data. Feature Selection has been achieved using correlation matrix. Feature Engineering has been done for the weak features.

Though further preprocessing of data might help in achieving better accuracy. 

The data is imbalanced so I've used F1-Score for model evaluation.
